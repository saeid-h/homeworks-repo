# Everywhere throughout this batch script file:
# * CHANGE yourusername to your username;
# * CHANGE youremailaddress@yourinstitution.edu to your e-mail address;
# * CHANGE directory_to_run_in to the directory you want to run in;
# * CHANGE jobname to your preferred name for this batch job.

# BEGIN BATCH SCRIPT
#
# The partition can be changed between gpu and debug_gpu.
#SBATCH --partition=gpu
#
# The SBATCH directive below says to use 1 CPU core of one CPU chip
# on one compute node, meaning that this batch jobs is non-parallel
# (serial). DON'T CHANGE THIS.
#
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#
# The SBATCH directive below indicates to the scheduler the amount of
# memory your job will use in megabytes.  This is critical information
# for scheduling of nonexclusive jobs, since it prevents the scheduler
# from assigning more jobs to a given compute node than that node
# has memory for.
#
#SBATCH --mem=1024
#
# STDOUT is the output that normally would go to the terminal screen.
# STDERR is like STDOUT, except that it contains error messages instead
# of regular output.
#
#SBATCH --output=/home/yourusername/directory_to_run_in/jobname_%J_stdout.txt
#SBATCH --error=/home/yourusername/directory_to_run_in/jobname_%J_stderr.txt
#
# The SBATCH directive below says to run for up to 12 hours (and zero
# minutes and zero seconds) of "wall clock" time (time experienced in
# real life).
# Currently, the maximum allowable wall clock time per batch job is
# 48:00 hours.
# 
# The debug_gpu partition has a maximum time limit of 00:30:00.  If you use
# this partition be sure your --time directive is 30 minutes or less.
#
#SBATCH --time=12:00:00
#
# The SBATCH directive below says the name of the batch job, as it
# will appear in the batch partition when you do an squeue command.
#
#SBATCH --job-name=jobname
#
# The SBATCH directive below says the e-mail address to send
# notifications to, which should be changed to your e-mail address.
#
#SBATCH --mail-user=youremailaddress@yourinstitution.edu
#
# The SBATCH directive below says to e-mail a notification when the
# batch job either completes or fails.
#
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
#
# Change to the directory that you want to run in.  This is more effective
# than using a cd command in the execution part of your script.
#
#SBATCH --workdir=/home/yourusername/directory_to_run_in
