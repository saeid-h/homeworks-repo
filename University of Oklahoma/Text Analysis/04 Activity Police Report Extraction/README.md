
#Important

In the course instruction about packaing in Python, there is no clue that *`__init__.py`* should be just available. It doesn't matter if it is empty or not. This file will not be created automatically, it **MUST** be created **BY USER**. Just an empty file solves the problem. Still I am not sure if my package would work on your machine. I tested it on my Windows and Mac machines as well as gpel8. It worked there correctly. Hope works on yours.

#Packages

The following packages are used in this code:

		1. urllib
		2. re
		3. PyPDF2
		4. io
		5. sqlite3
		6. random


	
#Functions

##fetchincidents()

This funciton fitches the Norman Police Department's web page and returns the page as a string.

##extractincidents()

First, fitches the Norman PD's web page and then finds the link addresses of incidents summary files by regular experssion. Secondly, it downloads the pdf files using the link addresses and converts thier contents into a string. Finally it makes a list of the records from the tables of these files and returns it. 
It was assumed that sometimes location field contains new lines which is handled.
	
##createdb()
	
A table was created by `sqlite3` and saved into *`normanpd.db`*. If the table is available it doesn't make a new one.

ID could be defined as primary key but it is not asked in the problem statement.
	
	
##populatedb(incidents)

The table created by ***createdb()*** was filled by collected data from ***extractincidents()***. ID is generated by program. If table is available it fetches the maximum id and count id after the max id. If there is no field available it starts with 1.
	
##status()

Some queries made up. In the *`main.py`* file, there was an argument db. It wasn't defined in the script and I got error for that. Asked Jacob and he permitted to ignore the argument.
