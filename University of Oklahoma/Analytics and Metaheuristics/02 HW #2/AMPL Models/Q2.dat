# Shortest Path MCNFP Problem Formulation 
# Adopted to tractor problem of assignment #2 
# created by Charles Nicholson, ISE 5113
# modified by Saeid Hosseinipoor for homework problem

# use with "Q2.mod" model
# note: default arc costs and lower bounds are 0
#      	default arc upper bounds are infinity
#      	default node requirements are 0


set NODES :=  	0 1 2 3;

param b:=	0  1     #for shortest path problem, start node supply = 1
        	3 -1;    #and the destination node supply = -1

# note: to make things a little more compact, you can use a "template" 
# for setting up costs.  See Chapter 9 "Specificying Data" in the AMPL textbook
